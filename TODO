Watchdog implement

What do we do if the elevator is stuck?


Bug report
*Orders made during init are not completed  (watchdog will probably fix)
*When elevators are on the same floor, they sometimes both take the order (might have to do with nodenameid)


Debugging right now (* = under work)
SortedViews in scheduler does not include other nodes
Worldviews in order_receiver does not include other nodes
*Due to concurrency, worldviews is not updated in time for first buttonpress
